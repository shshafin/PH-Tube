                    <p>1. <strong>var</strong> : Variables declared with var have function scope. This means they are
                        only scoped to the function in which they are declared. If a variable is declared inside a
                        function using var, it is not accessible outside that function.

                        If a variable is declared outside any function using var, it becomes a global variable and is
                        accessible throughout the entire program.</p> <br>
                    <p>2. <strong>let</strong> :

                        Variables declared with let have block scope. This means they are limited to the block,
                        statement, or expression in which they are defined. Blocks are denoted by curly braces {}.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        3. <strong>const</strong>
                        :

                        Variables declared with const also have block scope. However, const is used to declare
                        constants, meaning their values cannot be reassigned after initialization.

                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p> 1.<strong>null</strong>:

                        The null value is explicitly assigned to a variable to indicate the absence of any object value.
                        It is a deliberate empty value.

                        It is often used when you want to explicitly say that a variable should have no value or that an
                        object property should have no reference.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>2. <strong>undefined</strong>:

                        The undefined value represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a
                        value, or an object property that does not exist.

                        It is the default value of function parameters that are not provided.

                        It is automatically assigned to variables that are declared but not initialized.</p>

                    What do you mean by REST API?

                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an
                        architectural style for designing networked applications, and it is commonly used in the context
                        of web services. REST is not a specific technology but rather a set of architectural principles
                        and constraints.</p>
